# Why Coding Standards And Linting Matters

  
Coding standards are a set of guidelines, best practices, programming styles and conventions that developers adhere to when writing source code for a project. Most of the top companies have them.

A coding standards document tells developers how they must write their code. Instead of each developer coding in their own preferred style, they will write all code to the standards outlined in the document. This makes sure that a large project is coded in a consistent style â€” parts are not written differently by different programmers. Not only does this solution make the code easier to understand, but it also ensures that any developer who looks at the code will know what to expect throughout the entire application.

The point of a coding style standard and code linting is **not to say one style is objectively better than another in the sense of the specific details** (75 characters and one-true-brace convention, for example). Instead, **the point is to set up known expectations on how the code is going to look and to avoid 
problematic patterns or code that doesn't adhere to certain style guidelines.** 

So it's time for us to build our ecosystem together and help each other to have consistency in solid engineering practices in ourselves.
