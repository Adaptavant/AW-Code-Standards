## Sonarqube Configuration 

The SonarScanner for Gradle provides an easy way to start SonarQube analysis of a Gradle project.

The ability to execute the SonarQube analysis via a regular Gradle task makes it available anywhere Gradle is available (developer build, CI server, etc.), without the need to manually download, setup, and maintain a SonarQube Runner installation. The Gradle build already has much of the information needed for SonarQube to successfully analyze a project. By preconfiguring the analysis based on that information, the need for manual configuration is reduced significantly.
